Working Title: **"Coversations With Spirits"**

I am referencing the anime *Mob Psycho 100* specifically the spirit aspect of the show. The show has a varity of spirit interactions and characters, so I wanted my game to include seeing and talking to spirits.
I am providing the Fandom Wiki for reference: [Fandom Wiki](https://mob-psycho-100.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit)

Ideas include:
  1.  Interacting with spirits in order to get them to leave haunted areas.
  2.  The main character will take a call and investigate a haunted area, leading to a conversation with angry spirits.
  3.  Game ends by him succeeding in getting the spirit to leave.
