Working Title: **"Conversations With Spirits"**

I am referencing the anime *Mob Psycho 100*, specifically its spiritual aspect. The show features a variety of spirit interactions and characters, so I wanted my game to include the ability to see and talk to spirits.
I am providing the Fandom Wiki for reference: [Fandom Wiki](https://mob-psycho-100.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit)

Ideas include:
  1.  Interacting with spirits in order to get them to leave haunted areas.
  2.  The main character will take a call and investigate a haunted area, leading to a conversation with angry spirits.
  3. The game ends when he succeeds in getting the spirit to leave.
